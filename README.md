# Web Time Tracker Extension

A Chrome Extension that tracks how much time you spend on different websites. So, you can track how much time you spend on social media, work, or entertainment. 

## The Goal
The goal of this project is to create a lightweight tool that helps users become aware of their browsing habits without compromising their privacy. All data is processed and stored locally on the user's browser.

## Features (In Progress)
- Track active tab changes.
- Detect URL updates.
- Calculate time spent per domain.
- Save data to local storage.
- Beautiful dashboard to visualize time usage.

## Privacy First
Unlike other trackers, this extension:

Everything stays on your machine.
